					<p>Black holes are notable for many things, especially their simplicity. They're just … holes. That are "black." This simplicity allows us to draw surprising parallels between black holes and other branches of physics. For example, a team of researchers has shown that a special kind of particle can exist around a pair of black holes in a similar way as an electron can exist around a pair of hydrogen atoms — the first example of a "gravitational molecule." This strange object may give us hints to the identity of dark matter, to confirm the existence of gravitational molecules and the ultimate nature of space-time.</p>

					<h3>The dazzling Blue Ring Nebula puzzled scientists for 16 years — and now they finally understand why</h3><br><br>

					<p>Scientists have uncovered new evidence in the mysterious fluorescent debris of the Blue Ring Nebula that may explain how the strange structure formed. Researchers found that the blue ring is actually the base of a cone-shaped cloud of glowing molecular hydrogen that extends away from the central star, toward Earth. The new observations also show a second cone-shaped cloud that extends from the star in the opposite direction.The clouds of fluorescent debris formed after a sunlike star collided with and consumed a smaller stellar companion only a few thousand years ago.</p>

					<h3>Big dust storms may have driven off much of Mars' water</h3><br><br><br>

					<p>Martian dust storms fling water higher into the atmosphere than previously thought possible, helping to strip the Red Planet of its limited water and potentially contributing to the loss of an ocean's worth of water over billions of years. The research reveals that summer dust storms can send water to the top of Mars' atmosphere, destroying the molecule and allowing hydrogen to escape into space. Mars is thought to have supported an ocean or two, now researchers have learned that powerful summer dust storms may carry water above the hygropause, a cold layer in the atmosphere that traps water lower down.</p>

					<p>Two cosmonauts opened a new door to the outside of the International Space Station while preparing for the replacement of a two-decade-old Russian docking compartment.Sergey Ryzhikov, commander of the space station's Expedition 64 crew, and flight engineer Sergey Kud-Sverchkov, both of the Russian federal space agency Roscosmos, began a 6-hour, 48-minute spacewalk on Wednesday (Nov. 18), by inaugurating the use of the Poisk module as an airlock. The spacewalk (extravehicular activity, or EVA) began at 10:12 a.m. EST with the first opening of Poisk's airlock hatch. </p>

					<p>People living in coastal communities or navigating treacherous waters will both benefit from data flowing from the new Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich satellite mission.The satellite is expected to launch Saturday (Nov. 21) at 12:17 p.m. EST. Space Launch Complex 4 at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, on a five-year quest to map sea rise associated with global warming. Sentinel-6 will launch aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. Sentinel-6 observations will be included in such as sea wave forecasts and tropical storm predictions, to evacuate coastal populations quickly if the need arises.</p>

					<p>The first rover to explore the moon of another planet has started practicing for its landing, even though that historic touchdown is at least six years away.The 55-lb. (25 kilograms) robot is part of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency's (JAXA) Mar­tian Moons eX­plo­ration (MMX) mission, which is scheduled to launch in 2024 and arrive at the Red Planet the following year. In late 2026 or early 2027, the MMX Rover, which is being developed by a German-French team, will descend to the surface of the 14-mile-wide (22 kilometers) Phobos, the larger of Mars' two moons.</p>
